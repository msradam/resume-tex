# 🖋️ Adam's LaTeX Resume Template
This is the source code for my current resume as of July 2019. 

![Adam's Resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msradam/resume-tex/master/AdamRahman_Resume.png)


## Usage
I highly recommend having either an Overleaf account or texlive installed.
If the latter, make your necessary changes and enter:

`xelatex <your_resume>.tex`

You will see the .pdf output in the same directory.
