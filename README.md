# Adam Rahman's LaTeX Resume Template
This is the source code for my current resume as of July 2019. 

## Usage
I highly recommend having either an Overleaf account or texlive installed.
If the latter, make your necessary changes and enter:

`xelatex <your_resume>.tex`

You will see the .pdf output in the same directory.
